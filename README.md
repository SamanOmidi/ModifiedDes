# ModifiedDes  
In this project we are given 7 pairs of plain_text and cipher_text + the key.   
In boxes.py we have p-boxes and s-boxes needed for DES but the only thing we don't have is the straight p-box in DES function.  
Now we need to go from two direction to reach to the point we have before and after of straight p-box, and with a brute force attack we need to find the table of straight p-box.  
The project want us to decrypt the ciphertext given in pair.txt   
The final answer is in answer.txt + the table.
